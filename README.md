# Getting Started with Bash Testing

This repository holds an example Bash project which has been created for my guide [Getting Started with Bash Testing with Bats](https://stefanzweifel.dev/posts/2020/12/22/getting-started-with-bash-testing-with-bats).

Feel free to fork this repository to test things out or open a [discussion](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/getting-started-with-bash-testing/discussions) if you have questions or feedback.
