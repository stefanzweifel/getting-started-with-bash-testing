# Getting Started with Bash Testing

![tests](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/getting-started-with-bash-testing/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

This repository holds an example Bash project which has been created for my guide [Getting Started with Bash Testing with Bats](http://stefanzweifel.io/posts/2020/12/22/getting-started-with-bash-testing-with-bats/).

Feel free to fork this repository to test things out or open a [discussion](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/getting-started-with-bash-testing/discussions) if you have questions or feedback.
